The code in this repository is part of a larger comprehensive project which when applied, predicts the flexion of individual fingers from signals reorded from the surface of brain electrocorticography (ECoG) data. The performance of the resulting machine learning classifier is  evaluatd by calculating the average correlatioon coefficient between actural and predicted finger flexion data. Included are the following functions. Implemented functions include:


```
